# CodexTest

A small collection of experiments, currently featuring a terminal "worm" game.

## Worm Game

Use the arrow keys to steer the worm toward the shimmering food while avoiding
collisions with the walls or the worm's own body. Press `q` at any time to quit.

Run the game in a terminal that supports curses:

```bash
python3 worm.py
```
